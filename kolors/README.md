Kolors: Colorization and Recolorization via Diffusion Models

Kolors is an innovative approach to image colorization and recolorization using diffusion models. It offers a flexible and powerful method for adding or changing colors in images with high-quality results.

## Key Features

- **Colorization**: Add color to grayscale images with impressive detail and realism.
- **Recolorization**: Change colors in existing color images while maintaining structure and details.
- **Text-Guided Editing**: Use text prompts to guide the colorization process for specific outcomes.
- **Flexible Control**: Adjust colorization strength and blend with original colors as needed.

## Abstract from the Research Paper

We present Kolors, a novel approach for image colorization and recolorization using diffusion models. Our method leverages the power of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models to generate high-quality colorization results. Kolors introduces a flexible pipeline that allows for various levels of user control, from fully automatic colorization to precise color editing guided by text prompts or reference images.

## Example Applications

- Restoration of old black and white photographs
- Creative recoloring of existing images
- Text-guided color alterations for specific objects or scenes

## Contributions

- A unified framework for both colorization and recolorization tasks
- Integration with text-to-image diffusion models for high-quality results
- Flexible user control options for tailored colorization outcomes
